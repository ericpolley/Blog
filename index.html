          <h3>Creating a text-based button game</h3>
          <p>
            I have a concept for a text game. I outlined my idea in an earlier blog post. This project is a bit ambitious, but absolutely within possibility. It will be a great milestone marker for progress made with Javascript.  I have received help on the first part of the game in javascript. I am currently stuck, which is a perfect learning experience and hard reason to push forward with  learning. I am going to focus on learning Javascript to take the next step with this project. 
<br /><br /><br />
I am currently reading The ‘Gamers Guide to CODING’ by Gordon McComb. This book covers Javascript and presents it in a fun way. I am also using online learning resources like WarriorJS and Codewars.  
<br />
I am currently reading ‘Learn to Code. Get a Job’ by Gwendolyn Faraday. She suggests writing out your goals as a reminder to yourself when times are hard. I have written a list of goals by year for organization and motivation. This was a great suggestion.
<br />
I have written out a daily schedule plan, this is great for keeping on task.  I am revising it today, as it states on said schedule. Another great suggestion from Gwendolyn. 
<br /><br /><br />
I have also recorded my week 5 blog. I highlight some of the resources I have been using, some of my creations, and where I plan to go in the near future. I added a link to the video at the bottom of this post.

            <h3>Pair Programming and Side Project Opportunities </h3>
            <p>
              Yesterday, I had layed out my plan to create the project. 
              I decided to take a break before I got started building it.
              Right before I took a break I decided to check around on discord.
              [I have recently read about pair programming. and was excited to implement the practice]
              My expectation was low, I honestly thought I would put a message out there
              seeking like-minded folks to pair program. I posted in a few coding groups on Discord.
              <br />
              Before I was able to get up and continue on to my break I had planned earlier, I received a reply 
              "sure". This was unexpected, and exciting. I message the person directly, a few questions later, 
              I am sharing my screen, explaining this project that I am going to try to build.
              This person has a CS degree and 10 years of experience with an extended knowledge of Javascript.
              It was fun to teach them a thing or two about CSS. I learned a crazy amount from them. 
              We built the app about 20% and I decided I would like to know more on javascript before continuing. 
              We had been going for a few hours at this point. <br />
              Since our interaction, I have been studying and changing the code. <br />
              We had button one set to reveal [0] in the array.
              I set button 2 to [1], and 3 to [2]. Now revealing the corresponding text to each button and text area.
              I touched up the CSS to make it look nice. I saw an opportunity: This game
              as-is, would be a functional text-reveal to button. Check out the links below to see <strong>exactly</strong>
              what I am talking about. <br />In conclusion:
              <ul>
                <li>I have learned what it is like to pair-program with someone</li>
                <li>I started coding my text game project</li>
                <li>I created a webpage with interactive buttons</li>
              </ul>

            Through my reading I have been suggested to create a Project Story.
            <br />
            This sounds both productive and useful. I like the idea as it will
            help me practice communicating about the work I am doing, while I am
            working on it. <br />
            To get started with this, I have an idea for a game. The core
            concept is relatively simple, I am hoping the execution will follow.
            <br />
            The image to the right is the basic layout concept. I in detail
            about the vision and goals of this project, click 'Initial Concept
            and Layout' below.

            Idiocracy

          <p>
            I am currently coding this page. I considered using a blogging
            platform, but saw this as a coding exercise opportunity. <br />
            I am currently on my fifth week of Coding. I am starting with HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript. I have a plethora of learning sources
            including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>freeCodeCamp</li>
            <li>odinProject</li>
            <li>warriorjs</li>
            <li>codeWars</li>
            <li>hackerRank</li>
          </ul>
          I am reading a few books as well.
          <ul>

          <p>
            I have my learning sources, I have a criteria plan, and a curriculum
            set. <br />
            Though this will probably evolve over time, my current curriculum
            is:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Git</li>
            <li>React.JS</li>
            <li>Typescript</li>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>Kotlin</li>
            <li>SQL</li>
            <li>Python</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you know the industry, you probably know what I am going with
            that list. <br />
            My short-term goal current focus is be Web Development. As I dive
            deeper into the subject I will develope web apps and apps. With a
            few reputable projects, using each language, I will continue to
            learning Java and start with back-end development. <br />
            From here I would like to extend my knowledge of mobile engineering
            and start learning Kotlin. With a few projects I will continue
            forward <br />
            The next step is enforcing and gaining skills for back-end
            development. With that I will learn SQL, and then Python. <br />
            This leads me to my long-term end-goal of becoming a Full-Stack
            developer and UX/UI Mobile Developer
