                    <h3>Week 6</h3>
                    <p> Aug 16

                      Hello everyone, <br>
                      I am writing this before I record the vlog video listed in the links below. <br>
                      I have been spending a bit of time increasing my WPM (Words per minute)/typing speed. Keeping up with verbal communication as a typist is a valuable skill as a developer; as communicating to computers is the literal job description. Writing a blog is a great exercise for this exact task, for this reason I may over-explain some things, or seem a bit long winded. 
                      <br>
                      In short, the unnecessary text has a purpose!
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      As I have stated earlier I am writing this blog before I record the week 6 Vlog. With the Vlog in mind, let's lay out what I have done this week; and where I plan to go next.
                      <br>
                      <ul>
                      <li>Blog updates with github</li>
                      <li>Math Quiz Game</li>
                      <li>Tap to Flap</li>
                      <ul>
                      <br>
                      I am making an effort to update this blog regularly. I decided to create my own blog with custom code. This is great practice for coding, typing, and increases my webspace visibility.
                      <br>
                       This is also a great landing page and index for all of my projects. This helps me keep organized and gives a clear date for career related milestones. I plan to continue this blog for years to come. Though I am sure it will evolve along the way. <br>
                      <br>
                      I was so excited to get the Math Quiz working. I learned a lot from this tutorial as I mentioned in an earlier blog. To sum it up quickly, I learned functions, manipulating the DOM, button functionality: Start and Restart, Wrong answer and Right answer, 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      The tap to flap, which is clearly not a Flappy Birds Clone, was a fun challenge. I did not focus on the cosmetics for this project. I specifically wanted to focus on the gears and bolts of the game. I learned how to simulate gravity, add a character to a game, control the character with a button, and basic collisions! 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Yes, that was a lot to learn from two projects. I feel that to get the most out of these tutorials I will either do them both again, or follow along with a tutorial of the same, or similar, game. I am also thinking of spacing out the timing of recording the Vlog. I enjoy showing off the weeks work, but the further I am getting into Javascript, the longer the project takes. The quality of project will go up, but the quantity will go down. I don’t want to show off projects before they are done, and I dont wan’t to rush along projects. The point of these projects are for me to learn and understand, giving me tools to move on and create my own projects. Showing these projects off are just a bonus. <br>
                      I am also aware these kinds of projects are not portfolio material. <br>
                      The conclusion is that I am focusing on learning and creating this blog. The Vlog, while still important, is secondary and will therefore be uploaded less often.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      That being said I would like to do more live programming. Some hard evidence of my ability to struggle through problems. I would also like to work on some pair programming, preferably with some programmers around the same ability level as myself. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Alright then, I am signing off, till next time <br><br> -Eric

            <h3>Tap to Flap Game!</h3>
            <p> Hello reader. <br />
              I am Eric Polley, currently on my 6th week of Web Development. I am currently focusing on Javascript by 
              creating tutorials based on the needs of my current self produced project. <br /><br />
              Today I took on a tutorial: 'Flappy Birds Game' by 'KnifeCircus'. I found a lot of value in learning a restart function, simulating gravity,
               and using a button to activate a character function like jumping. This knowledge can be transferred to transition animations upon 'onclick'.   
             <br />
             I have also gained a general understanding of creating a clickable-button layout. Using buttons and clickable actions are a big part of creating games and apps.
             I would like to work on a few more tutorials of the same subject to get a further understanding of DOM manipulation, Objects, and Arrays.
           <br />
           To conclude, I have finished a 'flappy-birds' game at its base core functionality. You can play
           the game now, click on the link below!

                <h3>Tutorials</h3>
                <p>
                  While building the text based game I have run into a few road blocks. I know what I would like the app to do, but I do not know what code to write. <br />
                  This is a perfect learning opportunity. <br />
                  I have decided to follow a few tutorials that have some code implementation that appears to be what I am missing on my current project. 
                  <br />
                  I would like to have the game running properly before uploading a copy of it. 
                  <br />
                  I have followed one tutorial today, 'Build a quiz game' by 'Web Dev Simplified'. I really enjoy his formatting and quick pace.
                   I added a bit of CSS cosmetics to the final product and turned it into a math quiz. In this project I learned how to use the display:hide, onclick, accessing information from an object, and replacing divs and buttons in Javascript.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  My focus for these tutorials:
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li>Create a function Start and Restart Button</li>
                    <li>Create a Game Over</li>
                    <li>Create a way to keep score</li>
                    <li>Access an Array or Object to create a stream-line of levels</li>
                  </ul>
                  Great. Now That the goal is set, I am going to get going on some tutorials. The Quiz game I mentioned earlier is available in the links listed below.
                  <br />
                  Moving forward with Javascript, I plan to upload the next weekly Vlog in a few days.

          <h3>Learning Javascript</h3>
          <p>
            I have a concept for a text game. I outlined my idea in an earlier blog post. This project is a bit ambitious, but absolutely within possibility. It will be a great milestone marker for progress made with Javascript.  I have received help on the first part of the game in javascript. I am currently stuck, which is a perfect learning experience and hard reason to push forward with  learning. I am going to focus on learning Javascript to take the next step with this project. 
<br /><br /><br />
I am currently reading The ‘Gamers Guide to CODING’ by Gordon McComb. This book covers Javascript and presents it in a fun way. I am also using online learning resources like WarriorJS and Codewars.  
<br />
I am currently reading ‘Learn to Code. Get a Job’ by Gwendolyn Faraday. She suggests writing out your goals as a reminder to yourself when times are hard. I have written a list of goals by year for organization and motivation. This was a great suggestion.
<br />
I have written out a daily schedule plan, this is great for keeping on task.  I am revising it today, as it states on said schedule. Another great suggestion from Gwendolyn. 
<br /><br /><br />
I have also recorded my week 5 blog. I highlight some of the resources I have been using, some of my creations, and where I plan to go in the near future. I added a link to the video at the bottom of this post.

            <h3>Pair Programming and Side Project Opportunities </h3>
            <p>
              Yesterday, I had layed out my plan to create the project. 
              I decided to take a break before I got started building it.
              Right before I took a break I decided to check around on discord.
              [I have recently read about pair programming. and was excited to implement the practice]
              My expectation was low, I honestly thought I would put a message out there
              seeking like-minded folks to pair program. I posted in a few coding groups on Discord.
              <br />
              Before I was able to get up and continue on to my break I had planned earlier, I received a reply 
              "sure". This was unexpected, and exciting. I message the person directly, a few questions later, 
              I am sharing my screen, explaining this project that I am going to try to build.
              This person has a CS degree and 10 years of experience with an extended knowledge of Javascript.
              It was fun to teach them a thing or two about CSS. I learned a crazy amount from them. 
              We built the app about 20% and I decided I would like to know more on javascript before continuing. 
              We had been going for a few hours at this point. <br />
              Since our interaction, I have been studying and changing the code. <br />
              We had button one set to reveal [0] in the array.
              I set button 2 to [1], and 3 to [2]. Now revealing the corresponding text to each button and text area.
              I touched up the CSS to make it look nice. I saw an opportunity: This game
              as-is, would be a functional text-reveal to button. Check out the links below to see <strong>exactly</strong>
              what I am talking about. <br />In conclusion:
              <ul>
                <li>I have learned what it is like to pair-program with someone</li>
                <li>I started coding my text game project</li>
                <li>I created a webpage with interactive buttons</li>

          <h3>Creating a text-based button game</h3>
          <p>
            Through my reading I have been suggested to create a Project Story.
            <br />
            This sounds both productive and useful. I like the idea as it will
            help me practice communicating about the work I am doing, while I am
            working on it. <br />
            To get started with this, I have an idea for a game. The core
            concept is relatively simple, I am hoping the execution will follow.
            <br />
            The image to the right is the basic layout concept. I in detail
            about the vision and goals of this project, click 'Initial Concept
            and Layout' below.

            "I envy people who do a little of this, a little of that" -
            Idiocracy
          </p>
          <p>
            I am currently coding this page. I considered using a blogging
            platform, but saw this as a coding exercise opportunity. <br />
            I am currently on my fifth week of Coding. I am starting with HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript. I have a plethora of learning sources
            including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>freeCodeCamp</li>
            <li>odinProject</li>
            <li>warriorjs</li>
            <li>codeWars</li>
            <li>hackerRank</li>
          </ul>
          I am reading a few books as well.
          <ul>
            <li>Learn to Code. Get a job. - Gwendolyn Faraday</li>
            <li>Beginners Step-by-Step Coding Course - Darling Kindersley</li>
            <li>The Gamers guide to Coding - Gordon McComb</li>
            <li>
              Learning Coding Basics in Hours with Javascript - Tech Academy
            </li>
            <li>
              Get Coding! Learn HTML, CSS, and Javscript and build a website,
              app, and game <br />
              - Young Rewired State
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I have my learning sources, I have a criteria plan, and a curriculum
            set. <br />
            Though this will probably evolve over time, my current curriculum
            is:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Git</li>
            <li>React.JS</li>
            <li>Typescript</li>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>Kotlin</li>
            <li>SQL</li>
            <li>Python</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you know the industry, you probably know what I am going with
            that list. <br />
            My short-term goal current focus is be Web Development. As I dive
            deeper into the subject I will develope web apps and apps. With a
            few reputable projects, using each language, I will continue to
            learning Java and start with back-end development. <br />
            From here I would like to extend my knowledge of mobile engineering
            and start learning Kotlin. With a few projects I will continue
            forward <br />
            The next step is enforcing and gaining skills for back-end
            development. With that I will learn SQL, and then Python. <br />
            This leads me to my long-term end-goal of becoming a Full-Stack
            developer and UX/UI Mobile Developer
