                 <h3>Creating a text-based button game</h3>
                <p>Through my reading I have been suggested to create a Project Story. <br />
                This sounds both productive and useful. I like the idea as it will help me practice
            communication the work I am doing, while I am working on it. <br />
        To get started with this, I have an idea for a game. The core concept is relatively simple, 
    I am hoping the execution will follow. <br />
The image to the right is the basic layout concept. I in detail about the vision and goals of this project, click 'Initial Concept and Layout' below.</p>

                    <p>I am currently coding this page. I considered using a blogging platform, but saw this as a coding exercise opportunity. <br />
                    I am currently on my fifth week of Coding. I am starting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have a plethora of learning sources including:  </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>freeCodeCamp</li>
                        <li>odinProject</li>
                        <li>warriorjs</li>
                        <li>codeWars</li>
                        <li>hackerRank</li>
                    </ul>
                    I am reading a few books as well. 
                    <ul>

                        <li>Beginners Step-by-Step Coding Course - Darling Kindersley </li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>I have my learning sources, I have a criteria plan, and a curriculum set. <br />
                    Though this will probably evolve over time, my current curriculum is:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML</li>
                        <li>CSS</li>
                        <li>Javascript</li>
                        <li>Git</li>
                        <li>React.JS</li>
                        <li>Typescript</li>
                        <li>Java</li>
                        <li>Kotlin</li>
                        <li>SQL</li>
                        <li>Python</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you know the industry, you probably know what I am going with that list. <br />
                    My short-term goal current focus is be Web Development. As I dive deeper into the subject 
                I will develope web apps and apps. With a few reputable projects, using each language, I will continue
            to learning Java and start with back-end development. <br />
        From here I would like to extend my knowledge of mobile engineering and start learning Kotlin. With a few projects I will continue forward <br />
    The next step is enforcing and gaining skills for back-end development. With that I will learn SQL, and then Python. <br />
This leads me to my long-term end-goal of becoming a Full-Stack developer and UX/UI Mobile Developer </p>
